  Love the sound quality, but moreover the services offered by this company are pretty amazing!I ordered these earphones about 9 months ago and one of the ear buds stopped working about two weeks ago, I read about their manufacturer's warranty, and registered my product on their site and filed a complaint. They, then, picked up the earphones from my address, and sent a brand new one to the same address in two weeks and free of cost.

  I bought this in sept and I'm NOT SATISFIED with the purchase... Don't get me wrong, the sound quality is amazing for a earphone this cheap, but its flat... The bass kicks in only when there's too much bass in the music, else the sound feels very flat... Also the audio via the microphone is bad, and the mic is located on the split end of the cable, which is very low... At times I've heard people complaining that they cannot hear my voice clearly... Only for those who are struck with the price tag of 300-400rs... In that range its good, but if you can spend a 100rs more, get the basshead 225...

  This is a very great earphone with a good quality sound, but it's not for rough usage! The sound is flat, so less bass in regular condition! But the earphone has got a very good frequency range. So still a deep bass is possible but with an equalizer. You can try my preset.  Also remember that the quality of sound also depends on your device's sound card.

  I bought this earphone cause I had read in the reviews that they provide excellent after sales service and replace the earphone if any defect occurs. I had previously tried many companies earphones but in a few months always they would give problems. The sound quality and durability is amazing for the price. But due to rough usage one ear stopped working after 3 months. But the after sales services are amazing. They arranged a pickup of my old earphones and delivered a new pair to me after 10 days.Really happy customer

  For a price of rs 400 it's worth the cost, i previously used boat bassheads 225, now i tried this for pricing it does the job.Pros,Easy fitNice qualityGood bassInbuilt micCons.It doesn't have a clip or dual coloured ear buds noraml black only.Maybe you should give blue, red colour like other products.The connecting cable will be flat unlike folded one, that quite difficult while playing games or youtube bt you figure it out gow to mangae itUpdateAfter 9 months one side stopped working and i have complained in their official website with downloaded invoice from amazon and the next day my product was picked and in next 15 days got newer one. For the 400 rs it lasted about one and half years that was good for the price and it has one year warranty compared to mi and realme 6 months warranty and you have to carry your products to their outlets.Note .While claiming warranty you have to upload invoice that has to be downloaded only in pc version as of now ,so login amzon account in seperate browser in desktop mode or use pc to download the invoice.

  Love the sound quality, but moreover the services offered by this company are pretty amazing!I ordered these earphones about 9 months ago and one of the ear buds stopped working about two weeks ago, I read about their manufacturer's warranty, and registered my product on their site and filed a complaint. They, then, picked up the earphones from my address, and sent a brand new one to the same address in two weeks and free of cost.

  I bought this in sept and I'm NOT SATISFIED with the purchase... Don't get me wrong, the sound quality is amazing for a earphone this cheap, but its flat... The bass kicks in only when there's too much bass in the music, else the sound feels very flat... Also the audio via the microphone is bad, and the mic is located on the split end of the cable, which is very low... At times I've heard people complaining that they cannot hear my voice clearly... Only for those who are struck with the price tag of 300-400rs... In that range its good, but if you can spend a 100rs more, get the basshead 225...

  This is a very great earphone with a good quality sound, but it's not for rough usage! The sound is flat, so less bass in regular condition! But the earphone has got a very good frequency range. So still a deep bass is possible but with an equalizer. You can try my preset.  Also remember that the quality of sound also depends on your device's sound card.

  I bought this earphone cause I had read in the reviews that they provide excellent after sales service and replace the earphone if any defect occurs. I had previously tried many companies earphones but in a few months always they would give problems. The sound quality and durability is amazing for the price. But due to rough usage one ear stopped working after 3 months. But the after sales services are amazing. They arranged a pickup of my old earphones and delivered a new pair to me after 10 days.Really happy customer

  I bought this earphone cause I had read in the reviews that they provide excellent after sales service and replace the earphone if any defect occurs. I had previously tried many companies earphones but in a few months always they would give problems. The sound quality and durability is amazing for the price. But due to rough usage one ear stopped working after 3 months. But the after sales services are amazing. They arranged a pickup of my old earphones and delivered a new pair to me after 10 days.Really happy customer

  Love the sound quality, but moreover the services offered by this company are pretty amazing!I ordered these earphones about 9 months ago and one of the ear buds stopped working about two weeks ago, I read about their manufacturer's warranty, and registered my product on their site and filed a complaint. They, then, picked up the earphones from my address, and sent a brand new one to the same address in two weeks and free of cost.

  I bought this in sept and I'm NOT SATISFIED with the purchase... Don't get me wrong, the sound quality is amazing for a earphone this cheap, but its flat... The bass kicks in only when there's too much bass in the music, else the sound feels very flat... Also the audio via the microphone is bad, and the mic is located on the split end of the cable, which is very low... At times I've heard people complaining that they cannot hear my voice clearly... Only for those who are struck with the price tag of 300-400rs... In that range its good, but if you can spend a 100rs more, get the basshead 225...

  This is a very great earphone with a good quality sound, but it's not for rough usage! The sound is flat, so less bass in regular condition! But the earphone has got a very good frequency range. So still a deep bass is possible but with an equalizer. You can try my preset.  Also remember that the quality of sound also depends on your device's sound card.

  I bought this earphone cause I had read in the reviews that they provide excellent after sales service and replace the earphone if any defect occurs. I had previously tried many companies earphones but in a few months always they would give problems. The sound quality and durability is amazing for the price. But due to rough usage one ear stopped working after 3 months. But the after sales services are amazing. They arranged a pickup of my old earphones and delivered a new pair to me after 10 days.Really happy customer

  Love the sound quality, but moreover the services offered by this company are pretty amazing!I ordered these earphones about 9 months ago and one of the ear buds stopped working about two weeks ago, I read about their manufacturer's warranty, and registered my product on their site and filed a complaint. They, then, picked up the earphones from my address, and sent a brand new one to the same address in two weeks and free of cost.

  I bought this in sept and I'm NOT SATISFIED with the purchase... Don't get me wrong, the sound quality is amazing for a earphone this cheap, but its flat... The bass kicks in only when there's too much bass in the music, else the sound feels very flat... Also the audio via the microphone is bad, and the mic is located on the split end of the cable, which is very low... At times I've heard people complaining that they cannot hear my voice clearly... Only for those who are struck with the price tag of 300-400rs... In that range its good, but if you can spend a 100rs more, get the basshead 225...

  This is a very great earphone with a good quality sound, but it's not for rough usage! The sound is flat, so less bass in regular condition! But the earphone has got a very good frequency range. So still a deep bass is possible but with an equalizer. You can try my preset.  Also remember that the quality of sound also depends on your device's sound card.

  I bought this earphone cause I had read in the reviews that they provide excellent after sales service and replace the earphone if any defect occurs. I had previously tried many companies earphones but in a few months always they would give problems. The sound quality and durability is amazing for the price. But due to rough usage one ear stopped working after 3 months. But the after sales services are amazing. They arranged a pickup of my old earphones and delivered a new pair to me after 10 days.Really happy customer

Also its a light weight product.Sound quality<U+23EE><U+FE0F><U+23ED><U+FE0F> sound quality is good.Works well for soft and melody songs with my personal experience.Length<U+23EE><U+FE0F><U+23ED><U+FE0F> comes with long size cable which is a cool thing and I like it. One thing I like is that it comes with a strap to tangle the cable.Ear comfort <U+23EE><U+FE0F><U+23ED><U+FE0F> get fit easily in ears.Durability <U+23EE><U+FE0F><U+23ED><U+FE0F> It will depend what kind of user you are.

There is still noise in calling while traveling. So not satisfied with this noise cancellation Mike.I am not satisfied with the bass quality.  It works average.******************************************What you will get inside?<U+23EE><U+FE0F><U+23ED><U+FE0F> You will get earphone with some paperwork's and it comes with one year warranty  which you have to activate by calling on the mentioned number I guess.You will also get two pairs of additional ear protector for further use.I hope this will help you to make your purchase decision.<U+0001F60A>If you find my Review helpful then don't forget to hit the Helpful <U+0001F448> button.<U+0001F92D>

  Love the sound quality, but moreover the services offered by this company are pretty amazing!I ordered these earphones about 9 months ago and one of the ear buds stopped working about two weeks ago, I read about their manufacturer's warranty, and registered my product on their site and filed a complaint. They, then, picked up the earphones from my address, and sent a brand new one to the same address in two weeks and free of cost.

  I bought this in sept and I'm NOT SATISFIED with the purchase... Don't get me wrong, the sound quality is amazing for a earphone this cheap, but its flat... The bass kicks in only when there's too much bass in the music, else the sound feels very flat... Also the audio via the microphone is bad, and the mic is located on the split end of the cable, which is very low... At times I've heard people complaining that they cannot hear my voice clearly... Only for those who are struck with the price tag of 300-400rs... In that range its good, but if you can spend a 100rs more, get the basshead 225...

  This is a very great earphone with a good quality sound, but it's not for rough usage! The sound is flat, so less bass in regular condition! But the earphone has got a very good frequency range. So still a deep bass is possible but with an equalizer. You can try my preset.  Also remember that the quality of sound also depends on your device's sound card.

  I bought this earphone cause I had read in the reviews that they provide excellent after sales service and replace the earphone if any defect occurs. I had previously tried many companies earphones but in a few months always they would give problems. The sound quality and durability is amazing for the price. But due to rough usage one ear stopped working after 3 months. But the after sales services are amazing. They arranged a pickup of my old earphones and delivered a new pair to me after 10 days.Really happy customer
